# 🎵 Spotify Music Analysis  
### February 2026 — Codédex Dataset Challenge

---

## 📌 Overview  
This project explores the **Spotify Songs Dataset** to uncover patterns behind music popularity, genre trends, and audio characteristics.  
Using Python, Pandas, and visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, this analysis demonstrates:

- Which genres and artists are most popular  
- Which audio features correlate with popularity (danceability, energy, valence, etc.)  
- How song duration and release year influence popularity  
- Surprising trends hidden in modern music data  

This project was created for the **Codédex February 2026 Dataset Challenge**.

---

## 🎯 Objective  
> **Which music genres and artists achieve the highest popularity — and what patterns can we discover from the Spotify tracks dataset?**

This guiding question shapes the data exploration and visual analysis throughout the project.

## 🧪 Methodology

###  Data Inspection
- Review dataset structure  
- Check data types  
- Identify missing or duplicate values  

###  Data Cleaning
- Remove duplicates  
- Handle missing values  
- Normalize numeric features  
- Filter invalid popularity scores  

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Genre-level popularity comparison  
- Audio feature correlation analysis  
- Duration vs popularity trends  

###  Visualization
- Bar charts (genre popularity)  
- Scatter plots (features vs popularity)  
- Heatmaps (correlation analysis)  

###  Insights & Interpretation
- Identify key popularity drivers  
- Compare genre performance  
- Highlight surprising patterns  


## 📊 Example Visualizations

Examples include:
- Genre popularity bar chart  
- Danceability vs popularity scatter plot  
- Audio feature correlation heatmap  

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

### ✔ Popular tracks tend to be:
- Highly danceable  
- Medium energy  
- Between 2.8 and 3.5 minutes long  

### ✔ Top genres by popularity:
- Pop  
- EDM  
- Hip-Hop  

### ✔ Interesting observations:
- Danceability predicts popularity better than energy  
- Emotional (low-valence) tracks can still be very popular  
- Extremely long tracks rarely achieve high popularity
